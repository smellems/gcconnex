### Enabling Greater Collaboration Across the Public Service

---

## Description for a fan favourite voting
Get ready for the next big thing in GCconnex! Team OSS is happy to introduce three new features that will make collaboration--internal and external--even easier and add to what the GC2.0 Tools can do.

### Embedded videos
You can post external videos from Youtube, Vimeo and other platforms. All you have to do is add a link to your page, blog or group discussion to automatically embed your video. 

### Editing documents collaboratively in real-time (e-Docs)
Etherpad makes it possible for you and a number of other contributors to edit the same document at the same time--this means an end to having multiple versions floating around in Outlook and trying to make sense of all the changes!  You can easily create your own pads in GCconnex (by creating links to https://beta.etherpad.org/) with the e-Docs functionality. Our team even used an Etherpad to collaborate during Code GCconnex! Etherpad is open-source software (OSS), and Shared Services Canada could start by making it available behind the Government of Canada (GC) firewall.

### Departmental Activity Tabs
We know there is a lot going on in the GC: You may want to know what is happening in your very own department or in others.  You're not alone because departmental search is a highly requested feature.  As a result, we added two tabs to the Activity page: Tab 1 provides immediate access to the activity of your own department; Tab 2 does the same thing for the activity of any other departments of your choice. You could then filter, for example, to see only blogs written by people in your department.  ToDo: Filter by department so that you can also see another department's (not all others) activity.

Not only are these highly requested features already on Treasury Board Secretariat's 2015-16 Work Plan for GCconnex, but they are also cost-effective and noticeable upgrades to GCconnex. We also took care to choose tools you may already be familiar with--making it as easy as possible to collaborate internally or externally with GCconnex.

## Why is this the greatest addition to GCconnex?
Public servants are turning to GCconnex and GCpedia in exponentially growing numbers. Naturally, with this increase in use comes a high demand for increased functionality. As a result, our project has focused on providing a range of new features that GCconnex users are askign for. These are: Embedded videos, Editing documents collaboratively in real-time (e-Docs), and Departmental Activity Tabs.

These features are the greatest additions to GCconnex for three major reasons: 
*Because these features already figure in the 2015-2016 Work Plan, we know that there is a demand for them and that our upgrades are in line with the vision for the GC2.0 Tools. 
*They offer noticeable and cost-effective upgrades to GCconnex, while making it possible to collaborate externally. 
*This project has a combination of in-demand features that many people already know how to use.

## Most interesting insights observed by the team over the two days
Over the last two days, the team has made some interesting observations. 
*Coders: Many of use were using Elgg coding for the first time. This presented challenges in making the code do what we wanted it to do. Coding in PHP presented similar challenges to the team. 
*Communicators: We learned that we could contribute a lot more to the project than we initially thought we could, and we proved that long-distance collaboration (with the Yukon!) is possible--and fun!
